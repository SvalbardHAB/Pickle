## PICKLE universal telemetry board
Named after HMS Pickle (which brought the news of Nelson's victory in the Battle of Trafalgar back to England), this board has three key roles:

1. Data acquisition—PCB temperature, pressure, humidity, GPS location, external temperature
* Data logging—data saved to microSD card on PCB.
* Data/telemetry transmission—Data transmitted via 434MHz LoRa to base station. Tracked using Yagi directional antenna and matching LoRa base station.
